## Built With

-   [Javascript](https://javascript.com/)


## Features

In this project, I work with JavaScript to create a birthday app where you can see a list of people's birthdays. The data is from a local json file. I fetch them in my script file and display them with HTML and added styles to the page to make it looks good.

## How does it work

At the top of the web app, you can find an add somebody button where you can click and get a form for adding an item to the list. The two other fields are used for filtering. The first field is a search input field where you can type somebody's name from the the list and the list will only show that single person, the second field is a select field where you can filter the list by selecting one option and you will get a list of people who have their birthday at the selected month.

These are the list of things you can expect to see from the list: a profile picture, (the profile pictures are repeated because the are just random images), name, age, and number of days which is the number of days until their next birthday. You can edit a person's description by clicking the edit button. This will give you a form for editing. You can also delete an item from the list by clicking the delete button.
